# Python - Test Driven Development - Evercraft:

## Project Description:
" You will work directly with a partner this week to complete as many iterations of the Evercraft project, using the python language, as you can. Your partner and you will trade on and off on the writing of tests for Test Driven Development (TDD) and the code that will be executed."

## Tech Stack: 
- Python 3 - OOP
- pytest
- docker

## Requirements:
- [ ] must collaborate with partner(s) to learning python, talk through pseudocode and map out courses of action to get there
- [ ] get through 2 iterations 
- [ ] write tests and the code to get them to pass
- [ ] follow the examples and step through each task
- [ ] comment code well
- [ ] tests written first and then code to pass

## Stretch Goals:
- [ ] iteration 3
- [ ] iteration 4
- [ ] working dice roll

## Immediate Thoughts to Consider:
- how should we proceed with pair programming / ping pong programming with 3 partners?
- best procedure to work with 3 people?
    - rotate between who pseudocodes, writes the test, writes the code
- what do we need to know from d&d (the game itself) to understand the potential code involved?
- how should we use git flow to create feature branches? 


## MoSCoW
